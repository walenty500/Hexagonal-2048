# Hexagonal 2048 Game

## This is a project I created as my assignment. It's created fully in Python, using mainly Pyside2 module.

The game is based on a popular phone game called 2048, where you swipe to add rectangular tiles on 4x4 grid in order to get to a tile with a 2048 on it.

Instead of playing on a 4x4 rectangular grid on Hexagonal 2048 you can choose the board size from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5. Because of the hexagons you get 1D more, even though it's still in 2D.

The basics of the game are the same. It is extended by adding an option to save, and load the game from an .xml file. You can change your name, the board size and save it as a .json configuration file. You can also emulate/animate a game from a saved file.

The project has also a hot seat mode with fully web mode (based on python socket module) in developement on another branch.
